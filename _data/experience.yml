  description:
    - By non-linear mixed-effects (NLME) modeling of human sound localization data we uncovered level dependence of perceived sound direction and proposed a unified computational model, overhauling the established view in the field. Further mining of the data has revealed even more interesting effects of short- and long-term adaptation when localizing with interaural time differences. Analysis in R with nlme package.

    - We discovered a reversal in coding scheme of target sounds in presence of background interference (the cocktail party problem) at negative signal-to-noise ratios using a combination of signal processing, pattern recognition, unsupervised and supervised learning methods to process electrical activity of neurons.

  description:
    - Electronic circuit design and software development.
    - Proposed and partially implemented a robotic system with two arms for automation of steel processing laboratory of Mobarakeh Steel Company (Isfahan, Iran). Data from a PrimeSense depth camera installed on the first robotic arm combined with inverse kinematics was utilized to scan and construct a 3D cloud point of steel samples and the lab environment. This information was further used to automate steel sample preparation via rule-based artificial intelligence implemented on the second arm.
