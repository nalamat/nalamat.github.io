My portfolio and (soon to be) blog

This website is designed by myself, with inspiration from the following people:

- Alex Zharichenko: [alexzharichenko.me](https://alexzharichenko.me)
- Mathew Varughese: [matvarughese.me](https://matvarughese.me/portfolio.html)
- Zhengming Wang: [zmwang622.github.io](https://zmwang622.github.io)

Feel free to use it as a template for your own! Maybe mention me if you like :-)
